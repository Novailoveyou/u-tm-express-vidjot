## About

This is me following Brad Traversy's [udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/draft/1358300/)

Year 2021

## Things I leanred

- Intead of ``window`` global object in browser, Nodejs has ``global`` and ``process`` objects

## CLI

Get path for npm global folder

```zsh
npm root -g
```

### Mongodb CLI with mongosh

```zsh
mongosh
